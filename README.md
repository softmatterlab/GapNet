GapNet is an alternative deep-learning training approach that can usehighly incomplete datasets. This is the code for the arXiv paper [Neural Network Training with Highly Incomplete Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00429). 

## Dependencies 
* Python 3.8.5
* Tensorflow 2.5.0
* pydot 1.2.3
* Pandas 1.3.1
* scikit-learn 0.24.2

## Usage
To see GapNet working principle, we provide two well documented tutorial notebooks that train GapNet model on simulated dataset:



Each code example is a Jupyter Notebook that also includes detailed comments to guide the user. All neccesary files to run the code examples are provided.
